# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a powerful technique in marketing and data analysis. By leveraging Python, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and group them into segments based on their purchasing patterns.

## Introduction

Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to tailor their strategies effectively. RFM analysis is a data-driven method that segments customers based on three key metrics:

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spends on purchases.

This project utilizes Python for RFM analysis and customer segmentation, providing actionable insights for marketing and business strategies.

## Features

- Perform RFM analysis on customer transaction data.
- Segment customers based on RFM scores.
- Visualize customer segments for better understanding.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- plotly
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RFM-Analysis.git
cd RFM-analysis
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your customer transaction data in the `data` directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for RFM analysis.
3. Explore the customer segments and visualize the results.

## Data

Ensure your data is in a CSV format with columns like `CustomerID`, `Date`, and `Amount`. Example:

```
CustomerID,Date,Amount
1,2023-01-01,100.00
2,2023-01-02,50.00
...
```

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading:** Importing Libraries and Dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** Handle missing values , null values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** analyse data abd explore its features
5. **Calculate R,F,M Values:** Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
6. **Calculate RFM scores**  Define scoring criteria and calculate RFM score
8. **RFM value Segmentation:** Assign RFM scores and create RFM segments.
9. **RFM Customer Segmentation** Create and analyze RFM customer segments that are broader classifications based on RFM Scores 
10. **Visualization:** Visualize the customer segments for actionable insights.

## Results

Present visualizations and insights gained from the RFM analysis. Discuss potential marketing strategies for each customer segment.
